1) Histogram of Tweets

This is the same question as problem #6 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you're given a table Twitter tweet data, write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets posted per user in 2022. Output the tweet count per user as the bucket and the number of Twitter users who fall into that bucket.

In other words, group the users by the number of tweets they posted in 2022 and count the number of users in each group.

tweets Table:
Column Name	Type
tweet_id	integer
user_id	integer
msg	string
tweet_date	timestamp
tweets Example Input:
tweet_id	user_id	msg	tweet_date
214252	111	Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.	12/30/2021 00:00:00
739252	111	Despite the constant negative press covfefe	01/01/2022 00:00:00
846402	111	Following @NickSinghTech on Twitter changed my life!	02/14/2022 00:00:00
241425	254	If the salary is so competitive why wonâ€™t you tell me what it is?	03/01/2022 00:00:00
231574	148	I no longer have a manager. I can't be managed	03/23/2022 00:00:00
Example Output:
tweet_bucket	users_num
1	2
2	1

WITH CTE AS(
SELECT *  FROM tweets 
WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM tweet_date)='2022'),
CTE2 AS(
SELECT USER_ID, COUNT(*) AS CN 
FROM CTE GROUP BY USER_ID)
SELECT COUNT(CN) AS tweet_bucket, CN AS users_num
FROM CTE2 GROUP BY CN
ORDER BY COUNT(CN)

2)Data Science Skills
Given a table of candidates and their skills, you're tasked with finding the candidates best suited for an open Data Science job. You want to find candidates who are proficient in Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL.

Write a query to list the candidates who possess all of the required skills for the job. Sort the output by candidate ID in ascending order.

Assumption:

There are no duplicates in the candidates table.
candidates Table:
Column Name	Type
candidate_id	integer
skill	varchar
candidates Example Input:
candidate_id	skill
123	Python
123	Tableau
123	PostgreSQL
234	R
234	PowerBI
234	SQL Server
345	Python
345	Tableau
Example Output:
candidate_id
123

with cte as(
SELECT  candidate_id  FROM candidates
WHERE skill in ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL'))
select candidate_id from cte group by candidate_id having 
count(candidate_id)=3

3)Page With No Likes
Assume you're given two tables containing data about Facebook Pages and their respective likes (as in "Like a Facebook Page").

Write a query to return the IDs of the Facebook pages that have zero likes. The output should be sorted in ascending order based on the page IDs.

pages Table:
Column Name	Type
page_id	integer
page_name	varchar
pages Example Input:
page_id	page_name
20001	SQL Solutions
20045	Brain Exercises
20701	Tips for Data Analysts
page_likes Table:
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
page_id	integer
liked_date	datetime
page_likes Example Input:
user_id	page_id	liked_date
111	20001	04/08/2022 00:00:00
121	20045	03/12/2022 00:00:00
156	20001	07/25/2022 00:00:00
Example Output:
page_id
20701

SELECT p.page_id as page_id FROM pages p 
where p.page_id not in (select p1.page_id from page_likes p1)

4)Unfinished Parts
Tesla is investigating production bottlenecks and they need your help to extract the relevant data. Write a query to determine which parts have begun the assembly process but are not yet finished.

Assumptions:

parts_assembly table contains all parts currently in production, each at varying stages of the assembly process.
An unfinished part is one that lacks a finish_date.
This question is straightforward, so let's approach it with simplicity in both thinking and solution.

Effective April 11th 2023, the problem statement and assumptions were updated to enhance clarity.

parts_assembly Table
Column Name	Type
part	string
finish_date	datetime
assembly_step	integer
parts_assembly Example Input
part	finish_date	assembly_step
battery	01/22/2022 00:00:00	1
battery	02/22/2022 00:00:00	2
battery	03/22/2022 00:00:00	3
bumper	01/22/2022 00:00:00	1
bumper	02/22/2022 00:00:00	2
bumper		3
bumper		4
Example Output
part	assembly_step
bumper	3
bumper	4

SELECT part, assembly_step FROM parts_assembly
where finish_date is null
