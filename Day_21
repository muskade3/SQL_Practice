script:
create table section_data
(
section varchar(5),
number integer
)
insert into section_data
values ('A',5),('A',7),('A',10) ,('B',7),('B',9),('B',10) ,('C',9),('C',7),('C',9) ,('D',10),('D',3),('D',8);

Problem statement : we have a table which stores data of multiple sections. every section has 3 numbers
we have to find top 4 numbers from any 2 sections(2 numbers each) whose addition should be maximum
so in this case we will choose section b where we have 19(10+9) then we need to choose either C or D
because both has sum of 18 but in D we have 10 which is big from 9 so we will give priority to D.

Solution:-
with cte as(
  select *, row_number() over(partition by 
                             section 
                             order by number desc ) as rn 
   from section_data),
   cte2 as(
   select * from cte where rn<=2),
   cte3 as(

   select *, sum(number) over(partition by section order by rn desc) as numg from cte2 ),
   cte4 as(
   select *  ,max(numg) as s from cte3 group by section

   ),
   cte5 as(
   select *, dense_rank() over(order by s desc) as rn from cte4
   order by number desc
   limit 2)
   select  c.section  as section , c.number from cte3 c join cte5 c1 on c.section=c1.section
   order by c1.section , c1.number desc


Output:-
section	number
B	9
B	10
D	8
D	10
